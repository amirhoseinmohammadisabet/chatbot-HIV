    "What role does antiretroviral therapy (ART) play in the prevention of HIV transmission?": "The amount of HIV found in body fluids is called viral load. Taking effective HIV treatment (antiretroviral therapy) suppresses the amount of HIV in body fluids. This reduces viral load. When someone with HIV takes treatment as prescribed, it reduces their viral load, which means it lowers the amount of HIV virus in the blood. If viral load gets extremely low, it's known as an undetectable viral load. Having an undetectable viral load for 6 months or more means it is not possible to pass the virus on during sex. This is called undetectable=untransmutable (U=U), which can also be referred to as treatment as prevention.",
